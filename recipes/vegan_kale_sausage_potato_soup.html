	<img src="https://midwestfoodieblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/FINAL-vegan-potato-kale-soup-1-2.jpg">
	<p>This delicious and rich soup is perfect for winter. The suggesting amounts of ingredients are approximate and many substitutions are possible. Could use chard instead of kale, red or white potatoes (or others); I skipped the celery the first time because I didn't have any; use different spices as you like.</p>
	<h3>Ingredients</h3>
	<ul>
	    <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
	    <li>1 yellow onion, diced</li>
	    <li>1 c sliced carrot</li>
	    <li>1 c sliced celery</li>
	    <li>2 links vegan Italian sausage, sliced</li>
	    <li>5 cloves garlic, thinly sliced</li>
	    <li>2 tsp dried oregano</li>
	    <li>2 tsp dried thyme</li>
	    <li>1 tsp dried sage</li>
	    <li>1.5 lbs yukon gold potatoes, cubed</li>
	    <li>4 cups vegetable broth</li>
	    <li>1 (13.5 oz.) can full-fat coconut milk</li>
	    <li>4-5 c chopped kale</li>
	    <li>1 tbsp white wine vinegar</li>
	    <li>kosher salt</li>
	    <li>pepper</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Steps</h3>	
	<ol>
	    <li>Heat oil in soup pot on medium. Add onion and cook until golden.</li>
	    <li>Add carrot, celery, sausage. Cook until sausage brown and vegetables soft.</li>
	    <li>Add garlic and spices and cook, stirring frequently for another minute or so</li>
	    <li>Add potatoes, broth, and coconut milk. Heat until bubbling then cover and simmer on low heat until potatoes are soft, about 10-15 minutes.</li>
	    <li>Add kale, vinegar, and salt and pepper. Cook a few more minutes until the kale is tender.</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>Notes</h4>
	<p>The first time making this I added sausage to the original recipe. I didn't have any celery and just skipped it. I used rice vinegar instead of white wine. For the coconut milk I used Trader Joe's coconut cream. I also used Trader Joe's brand sausage.</p>
